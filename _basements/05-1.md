## Here's something we solved:

we estimated the symplectic systolic ratio of lagrangian products $K \times Q$, where $K$ is any convex 2D shape, and $Q$ is any quadrilateral. In fancy words, this is about Viterbo's conjecture. In simple words, it's about the smallest area of a convex shape than can cover a translate of each of the four triangles:
