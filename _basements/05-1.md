## Here's something we solved.

In fancy words, it's a special case of Viterbo's conjecture on symplectic capacities: we estimated the symplectic systolic ratio of lagrangian products $K \times Q$, where $K$ is any convex 2D shape, and $Q$ is any quadrilateral. In simple words, it's about the smallest area of a convex shape that can cover a translate of each of the four triangles:
